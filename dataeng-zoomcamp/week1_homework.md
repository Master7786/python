## Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment 
and practice with terraform and SQL

## Question 1. Google Cloud SDK

Install Google Cloud SDK. What's the version you have? 

To get the version, run `gcloud --version`
Google Cloud SDK 368.0.0

## Google Cloud account 

Create an account in Google Cloud and create a project.


## Question 2. Terraform 

Now install terraform and go to the terraform directory (`week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform`)

After that, run

* `terraform init`
* `terraform plan`
* `terraform apply` 

Apply the plan and copy the output (after running `apply`) to the form


# output for terraform init ::

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/google from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/google v4.6.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.


# output for terraform plan ::

var.project
  Your GCP Project ID

  Enter a value: data-terraform-338612


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created
  + resource "google_bigquery_dataset" "dataset" {
      + creation_time              = (known after apply)
      + dataset_id                 = "trips_data_all"
      + delete_contents_on_destroy = false
      + etag                       = (known after apply)
      + id                         = (known after apply)
      + last_modified_time         = (known after apply)
      + location                   = "europe-west6"
      + project                    = "data-terraform-338612"
      + self_link                  = (known after apply)

      + access {
          + domain         = (known after apply)
          + group_by_email = (known after apply)
          + role           = (known after apply)
          + special_group  = (known after apply)
          + user_by_email  = (known after apply)

          + view {
              + dataset_id = (known after apply)
              + project_id = (known after apply)
              + table_id   = (known after apply)
            }
        }
    }

  # google_storage_bucket.data-lake-bucket will be created
  + resource "google_storage_bucket" "data-lake-bucket" {
      + force_destroy               = true
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + location                    = "EUROPE-WEST6"
      + name                        = "dtc_data_lake_data-terraform-338612"
      + project                     = (known after apply)
      + self_link                   = (known after apply)
      + storage_class               = "STANDARD"
      + uniform_bucket_level_access = true
      + url                         = (known after apply)

      + lifecycle_rule {
          + action {
              + type = "Delete"
            }

          + condition {
              + age                   = 30
              + matches_storage_class = []
              + with_state            = (known after apply)
            }
        }

      + versioning {
          + enabled = true
        }
    }

Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

Apply complete! Resources: 2 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.


## Prepare Postgres 

Run Postgres and load data as shown in the videos

We'll use the yellow taxi trips from January 2021:

```bash
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/trip+data/yellow_tripdata_2021-01.csv
```

You will also need the dataset with zones:

```bash 
wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/nyc-tlc/misc/taxi+_zone_lookup.csv
```

Download this data and put it to Postgres

## Question 3. Count records 

1369765

How many taxi trips were there on January 15?

select cast(tpep_pickup_datetime as date) as date,  count(1) 
from ny_taxi_data
GROUP by date
having cast(tpep_pickup_datetime as date) = '2021-01-15';

53024

Consider only trips that started on January 15.

## Question 4. Average

Find the largest tip for each day. 
On which day it was the largest tip in January?

Use the pick up time for your calculations.

(note: it's not a typo, it's "tip", not "trip")

select
date_trunc('month', tpep_pickup_datetime) as month, 
max(tip_amount), min(tip_amount)
from ny_taxi_data
GROUP by month
having date_trunc('month', tpep_pickup_datetime) = '2021-01-01'
order by month;

1140.44

## Question 5. Most popular destination

What was the most popular destination for passengers picked up 
in central park on January 14?

Use the pick up time for your calculations.

Enter the zone name (not id). If the zone name is unknown (missing), write "Unknown" 

select COALESCE(t2."Zone",'Unknown'), count(t1."index") as "count" 
from ny_taxi_data t1, zones t2 
where t1."DOLocationID" = t2."LocationID" and t1."PULocationID" = 43 and 
cast(t1.tpep_pickup_datetime as date) = '2021-01-14'
group by t2."Zone"
order by "count" desc;

"Upper East Side South"

## Question 6. 

What's the pickup-dropoff pair with the largest 
average price for a ride (calculated based on `total_amount`)?

Enter two zone names separated by a slash

For example:

"Jamaica Bay / Clinton East"

If any of the zone names are unknown (missing), write "Unknown". For example, "Unknown / Clinton East". 

select concat(COALESCE(t2."Zone",'Unknown'), '/' ,COALESCE(t3."Zone",'Unknown')),
max(t1."total_amount") as max_total from ny_taxi_data t1
join zones t2 on t1."PULocationID" = t2."LocationID"
join zones t3 on t1."DOLocationID" = t3."LocationID"
group by t2."Zone", t3."Zone"
order by max_total desc;

"Lenox Hill East/Upper East Side North"
